- This app lets users search instagram by tag or by user id. HA good luck knowing you're user id... No OAuth requred thouh. 

- Users can heart photos and add them to a favorites list and if the photos has it's location shared the user can view it on a map. 

- Uses UITableViews, MapView, NSURLConnection, Twitter, Mail, Woot...

- There's a weird bug that happens, so far only on the simulator saying 
```objective-c
//An instance 0x7fdd5267b550 of class Photo was deallocated while key value observers were still registered with it.
```
Not sure what to do about that one...
